      The famous saying “The greatest use of life is to spend it for something that will outlast it” is rather thought-provoking, which tells us the real meaning of life. It is contemporary social issue in China with common interests and permanent value.

　　In my view, there are good reasons to undertake meaningful things that exert positive and profound influence on society, such as protecting the environment, helping vulnerable groups as well as promoting education. To illustrate, Abraham Lincoln never wavered in his devotion to democracy and equality, whose life has become an inspiration in the United States and throughout the whole world. His life, though limited, definitely lasts longer, and is a life worth living. Likewise, a young person who aspires to be a great writer might decide to buy some literary books or spend weekends writing and refining his works. Without any aspiration, he might simply end up spending all his spare time surfing online or playing Internet games.

　　In brief, a meaningful life serves to motivate and guide us in our daily lives. It provides us with the focus and direction that enable us to work towards accomplishing a special goal, objective or task.

    “将生命花在比生命更长远的事上，就是尽用生命”这一名言相当发人深思。它告诫我们人生的真正意义。这是人们普遍关注并拥有永恒价值的一个问题。

　　在我看来，我们有充分的理由从事对社会产生积极深远影响的、有意义的事情，例如保护环境、帮助弱势群体及发展教育。例如，亚伯拉罕·林肯从未放弃投身于民主及平等事业。他的人生成为对美国以及整个世界的一种鼓舞。他的生命尽管有限，但无疑长久延续并意义非凡。同样，一个渴望成为伟大作家的人，或许会决定买一些文学书或把整个周末的时间用于写作并润色自己的作品。而如果没有志气的话，他也许只会将所有的闲暇时间用于上网或玩网络游戏。

　　总之，有意义的人生在日常生活中激励和指导着我们。它为我们提供了专注的焦点和方向的指引，使我们能够通过努力实现一个具体目标或任务。
